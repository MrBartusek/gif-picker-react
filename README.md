An [Tenor](https://tenor.comt) GIF picker component for React applications that runs on [Tenor API V2](https://developers.google.com/tenor/guides/quickstart). This picker fits styling of [emoji-picker-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emoji-picker-react) and can be used next to it.

## What to know before using

- In order to access Tenor API you are **required** to provide API key. This is a free and simple process that takes less than 60 seconds.

  library comply with that rule by adding *Search Tenor* placeholder to the search bar.

## Installation

```bash
npm install gif-picker-react
```

```jsx
<GifPicker height={500} width={400} />
```

```jsx
<GifPicker height="100%" width="15em" />
```

### CSS Variables

The picker can be customized via CSS variables. The root selector for the picker is `.GifPickerReact`, when overriding, make sure to provide a more specific selector.

The list of possible variables is quite extensive, but the main ones you may want to override are:

- `--gpr-bg-color` - Background color of the picker.
- `--gpr-text-color` - Font color on the picker.
- `--gpr-highlight-color` - Color on the hover on focus on some search bar, categories and gif.

You can find full list of all variables in [GifPickerReact.css](https://github.com/MrBartusek/gif-picker-react/blob/master/src/GifPickerReact.css).
